Terraform Questions List

1. Your team is new to Terraform. A colleague asks: *"What is Terraform and why should we use it over CloudFormation for our AWS infrastructure?"
2. Your manager wants to understand what `terraform plan` does before you run `terraform apply` on production AWS.
3. You need to create an EC2 instance and an S3 bucket using Terraform. Write the basic configuration.
4. You need to provision 5 identical EC2 instances. You don't want to copy-paste the same resource block 5 times.
5. You need to output the public IP of a created EC2 instance so other teams can use it.
6. You have an RDS instance that was created manually in AWS. You want to bring it under Terraform management without recreating it.
7. Deploy a web app with ALB, Auto Scaling Group, and EC2 instances across 3 AZs.
8. Provision an RDS PostgreSQL in a private subnet with a read replica. Password must NOT be hardcoded.
9. Deploy a Lambda function with API Gateway trigger and IAM permissions to read from DynamoDB.
10. Your team needs a production EKS cluster with managed node groups in private subnets.
11. Deploy a static website on S3 with CloudFront CDN and HTTPS.
12. Your app needs a Redis caching layer. Provision an ElastiCache Redis cluster in private subnets.
13. Build an event-driven pipeline where SNS fans out to multiple SQS queues.
14. Your team has 3 engineers all running Terraform locally and state files are getting corrupted.
15. A Terraform apply failed halfway and now the state is locked. Your colleague can't run any Terraform commands.
16. You want to manage dev, staging, and prod environments with the same Terraform code but separate state files
17. Your networking team manages the VPC. Your app team manages EC2. How do they share subnet IDs?
18. Someone accidentally deleted the production state file. How do you recover?
19. You have 10 microservices, each needing an ECS service, IAM role, and CloudWatch log group. Copy-pasting Terraform code 10 times is unmanageable.
20. You want to use a community VPC module instead of writing one from scratch.
21.  Your module needs to deploy resources in a specific AWS region passed by the caller.
22. Your platform team wants to publish an internal Terraform module that all app teams can use with versioning.
23. A developer hardcoded AWS access keys in a Terraform file and pushed to GitHub.
24. Security team requires least-privilege IAM policies. EC2 instance should only read from a specific S3 bucket.
25. You need to prevent a critical production RDS instance from being accidentally destroyed via `terraform destroy`
26. Your app needs multiple secrets (DB password, API keys, JWT secret). How do you manage them without hardcoding?
27. Your compliance team requires AWS Config and CloudTrail to be enabled in all accounts.
28. Build a production VPC from scratch with public and private subnets, NAT gateways, and an internet gateway.
29. ALB accepts internet traffic. App server only accepts from ALB. DB only accepts from App server.
30. Your app VPC needs to connect to a shared-services VPC that hosts internal tools.
31. You have 10 VPCs that all need to talk to each other. VPC peering becomes unmanageable (n*(n-1)/2 connections).
32. On PRs run `terraform plan` and post as comment. On merge to main, run `terraform apply`.
33. Configure the AWS IAM role that GitHub Actions can assume via OIDC without static access keys.
34. Your organization has separate AWS accounts for dev and prod. How do you manage both from one Terraform pipeline?
35. You want to enforce quality gates on all Terraform PRs automatically.
36. Your manager wants to be alerted when someone manually changes AWS resources outside of Terraform.
37. Terraform plan shows it wants to delete and recreate a production EC2 because someone manually changed its instance type in the console.
38. You get `Error: Cycle: aws_security_group.app, aws_security_group.db`. What does this mean and how do you fix it?
39. Terraform plan says it will "destroy" a resource that was already manually deleted from AWS.
40. You want to apply changes only to a specific resource without touching the rest of your infrastructure.
41. Terraform apply is failing with a cryptic error. How do you get more detail?
42. You need a security group with a variable number of ingress rules per environment. Dev needs 3, prod needs 7.
43. Your organization has 15 AWS accounts. Managing backends and provider configs is getting unmanageable.
44. Deploy the same infrastructure to us-east-1 and eu-west-1 using the same code.
45. What is the difference between `terraform taint` and `terraform apply -replace`?

## 🏗️ Core Terraform Concepts

---

### Q1 — What is Terraform and why use it over AWS CloudFormation?

> 🎯 **Scenario:** Your team is new to Terraform. A colleague asks: *"What is Terraform and why should we use it over CloudFormation for our AWS infrastructure?"*

**Answer:**

Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tool by HashiCorp that uses **HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language)** to define and provision infrastructure across any cloud provider.

| Feature | Terraform | CloudFormation |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| Cloud support | Multi-cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP…) | AWS only |
| Language | HCL (readable, concise) | JSON/YAML (verbose) |
| State management | External state file (flexible) | Managed by AWS |
| Plan before apply | ✅ `terraform plan` | ❌ Change sets (limited) |
| Module ecosystem | Rich Terraform Registry | Nested stacks (complex) |
| Drift detection | ✅ `terraform plan` shows drift | Stack drift detection |

> 💡 **Key difference:** CloudFormation is AWS-only. Terraform is cloud-agnostic — the same patterns work on AWS, Azure, GCP, and 300+ providers simultaneously.

---

### Q2 — Explain the Terraform lifecycle

> 🎯 **Scenario:** Your manager wants to understand what `terraform plan` does before you run `terraform apply` on production AWS.

**Answer:**

The Terraform workflow has four key phases:

1. **Write** — Define infrastructure in `.tf` files using HCL
2. **Init** — Download providers and modules
3. **Plan** — Compute and show a diff (create/change/destroy)
4. **Apply** — Execute the plan and update state

```bash
# Step 1: Initialize providers
terraform init

# Step 2: Validate configuration
terraform validate

# Step 3: Preview changes (SAFE — no AWS calls that modify infra)
terraform plan -out=tfplan

# Step 4: Apply the saved plan to AWS
terraform apply tfplan

# Step 5: Destroy infrastructure
terraform destroy
```

> ✅ **Best practice:** Always use `terraform plan -out=tfplan` then `terraform apply tfplan` in production — this ensures exactly what was reviewed gets applied, even if infra changes between plan and apply.

---

### Q3 — Create an EC2 instance and S3 bucket using Terraform

> 🎯 **Scenario:** You need to create an EC2 instance and an S3 bucket using Terraform. Write the basic configuration.

**Answer:**

```hcl
# main.tf

# Provider configuration
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = var.aws_region
}

# Latest Amazon Linux 2023 AMI
data "aws_ami" "amazon_linux" {
  most_recent = true
  owners      = ["amazon"]

  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["al2023-ami-*-x86_64"]
  }
}

# EC2 Instance
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = data.aws_ami.amazon_linux.id
  instance_type = var.instance_type

  tags = {
    Name        = "web-server"
    Environment = var.environment
    ManagedBy   = "terraform"
  }
}

# S3 Bucket
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "app_bucket" {
  bucket = "${var.project_name}-${var.environment}-assets"

  tags = {
    Name        = "app-assets"
    Environment = var.environment
  }
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_versioning" "app_bucket_versioning" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.app_bucket.id
  versioning_configuration {
    status = "Enabled"
  }
}
```

```hcl
# variables.tf

variable "aws_region" {
  description = "AWS region to deploy into"
  type        = string
  default     = "us-east-1"
}

variable "instance_type" {
  description = "EC2 instance type"
  type        = string
  default     = "t3.micro"
}

variable "environment" {
  description = "Deployment environment"
  type        = string
  validation {
    condition     = contains(["dev", "staging", "prod"], var.environment)
    error_message = "Must be dev, staging, or prod."
  }
}
```

---

### Q4 — Create multiple EC2 instances without copy-pasting

> 🎯 **Scenario:** You need to provision 5 identical EC2 instances. You don't want to copy-paste the same resource block 5 times.

**Answer:**

Use **`count`** or **`for_each`** meta-arguments:

```hcl
# count approach
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  count         = 5
  ami           = data.aws_ami.amazon_linux.id
  instance_type = "t3.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "web-server-${count.index + 1}"
  }
}
# Outputs: aws_instance.web[0] … aws_instance.web[4]
```

```hcl
# for_each approach (PREFERRED)
variable "servers" {
  type = map(string)
  default = {
    web-1 = "t3.micro"
    web-2 = "t3.micro"
    api-1 = "t3.small"
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "servers" {
  for_each      = var.servers
  ami           = data.aws_ami.amazon_linux.id
  instance_type = each.value

  tags = { Name = each.key }
}
# Outputs: aws_instance.servers["web-1"], ["web-2"], ["api-1"]
```

> 💡 **Prefer `for_each` over `count`** — if you remove an item from the middle of a count list, Terraform renumbers everything and may destroy/recreate resources. `for_each` uses stable keys.

---

### Q5 — Expose EC2 public IP and S3 bucket name as outputs

> 🎯 **Scenario:** You need to output the public IP of a created EC2 instance so other teams can use it.

**Answer:**

```hcl
# outputs.tf

output "ec2_public_ip" {
  description = "Public IP of the web server"
  value       = aws_instance.web.public_ip
}

output "s3_bucket_name" {
  description = "Name of the S3 asset bucket"
  value       = aws_s3_bucket.app_bucket.bucket
}

output "db_password" {
  description = "RDS password"
  value       = aws_db_instance.rds.password
  sensitive   = true   # Hides from CLI output
}
```

```bash
# View all outputs
terraform output

# Get specific output as raw string (useful in scripts)
terraform output -raw ec2_public_ip

# Get outputs as JSON (for CI/CD pipelines)
terraform output -json
```

---

### Q6 — Import an existing RDS instance into Terraform

> 🎯 **Scenario:** You have an RDS instance that was created manually in AWS. You want to bring it under Terraform management without recreating it.

**Answer:**

Use **`terraform import`** to import existing AWS resources into Terraform state:

```bash
# 1. Write the resource block in your .tf file first
# 2. Import the existing resource into state

terraform import aws_db_instance.mydb my-production-db
terraform import aws_s3_bucket.existing my-existing-bucket-name
terraform import aws_instance.web i-0abcd1234efgh5678
terraform import aws_vpc.main vpc-0a1b2c3d4e5f67890
```

> ⚠️ **After importing**, run `terraform plan` — if it shows changes, your HCL configuration doesn't exactly match the live resource. Adjust until plan shows "No changes."

**Terraform 1.5+ declarative import block:**

```hcl
import {
  to = aws_db_instance.mydb
  id = "my-production-db"
}
```

  default_action {
    type             = "forward"
    target_group_arn = aws_lb_target_group.web.arn
  }
}
```

### Q8 — Provision RDS PostgreSQL with read replica (no hardcoded passwords)

> 🎯 **Scenario:** Provision an RDS PostgreSQL in a private subnet with a read replica. Password must NOT be hardcoded.

**Answer:**

```hcl
# Fetch password from AWS Secrets Manager (never hardcode!)
data "aws_secretsmanager_secret_version" "db" {
  secret_id = "prod/rds/password"
}

resource "aws_db_subnet_group" "main" {
  name       = "main-db-subnet-group"
  subnet_ids = aws_subnet.private[*].id
}

# Primary RDS instance
resource "aws_db_instance" "primary" {
  identifier             = "prod-postgres"
  engine                 = "postgres"
  engine_version         = "15.4"
  instance_class         = "db.t3.medium"
  allocated_storage      = 100
  storage_encrypted      = true
  db_subnet_group_name   = aws_db_subnet_group.main.name
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.rds.id]
  username               = "dbadmin"
  password               = jsondecode(data.aws_secretsmanager_secret_version.db.secret_string)["password"]
  multi_az               = true
  backup_retention_period = 7
  deletion_protection    = true
  skip_final_snapshot    = false
  final_snapshot_identifier = "prod-postgres-final"
}

# Read Replica
resource "aws_db_instance" "replica" {
  identifier          = "prod-postgres-replica"
  replicate_source_db = aws_db_instance.primary.identifier
  instance_class      = "db.t3.small"
  publicly_accessible = false
}
```

> 🚨 **Never** store database passwords in `terraform.tfvars` or hardcode them in HCL. Terraform state stores values in plaintext — always enable encryption on your S3 state backend.

### Q13 — Set up SQS + SNS for event-driven architecture

> 🎯 **Scenario:** Build an event-driven pipeline where SNS fans out to multiple SQS queues.

**Answer:**

```hcl
# SNS Topic
resource "aws_sns_topic" "orders" {
  name = "orders-topic"
}

# SQS Queues with Dead Letter Queues
resource "aws_sqs_queue" "orders_dlq" {
  name                      = "orders-dlq"
  message_retention_seconds = 1209600  # 14 days
}

resource "aws_sqs_queue" "orders" {
  name                       = "orders-queue"
  visibility_timeout_seconds = 300
  message_retention_seconds  = 86400

  redrive_policy = jsonencode({
    deadLetterTargetArn = aws_sqs_queue.orders_dlq.arn
    maxReceiveCount     = 3
  })
}

# SNS → SQS subscription
resource "aws_sns_topic_subscription" "orders_sqs" {
  topic_arn = aws_sns_topic.orders.arn
  protocol  = "sqs"
  endpoint  = aws_sqs_queue.orders.arn
}

# SQS policy to allow SNS to send messages
resource "aws_sqs_queue_policy" "orders" {
  queue_url = aws_sqs_queue.orders.id
  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [{
      Effect    = "Allow"
      Principal = { Service = "sns.amazonaws.com" }
      Action    = "sqs:SendMessage"
      Resource  = aws_sqs_queue.orders.arn
      Condition = {
        ArnEquals = { "aws:SourceArn" = aws_sns_topic.orders.arn }
      }
    }]
  })
}
```

## 🗄️ State Management

### Q14 — Fix corrupted state when multiple engineers run Terraform locally

> 🎯 **Scenario:** Your team has 3 engineers all running Terraform locally and state files are getting corrupted.

**Answer:**

Configure a **remote backend** using S3 + DynamoDB for centralized state storage and locking:

```hcl
# backend.tf
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-company-terraform-state"
    key            = "prod/us-east-1/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    encrypt        = true
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-state-lock"
    kms_key_id     = "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789:key/abc-123"
  }
}
```

```hcl
# Bootstrap the S3 + DynamoDB backend
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "tf_state" {
  bucket = "my-company-terraform-state"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_versioning" "tf_state" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.tf_state.id
  versioning_configuration { status = "Enabled" }
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_server_side_encryption_configuration" "tf_state" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.tf_state.id
  rule {
    apply_server_side_encryption_by_default {
      sse_algorithm = "aws:kms"
    }
  }
}

# DynamoDB table for state locking
resource "aws_dynamodb_table" "tf_lock" {
  name         = "terraform-state-lock"
  billing_mode = "PAY_PER_REQUEST"
  hash_key     = "LockID"

  attribute {
    name = "LockID"
    type = "S"
  }
}
```

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| S3 Bucket | Stores `terraform.tfstate` files centrally |
| S3 Versioning | Allows state rollback if something goes wrong |
| S3 Encryption | Encrypts state file at rest (contains sensitive data) |
| DynamoDB Table | Provides state locking — prevents concurrent applies |

---

### Q15 — Fix a stuck state lock after a failed apply

> 🎯 **Scenario:** A Terraform apply failed halfway and now the state is locked. Your colleague can't run any Terraform commands.

**Answer:**

```bash
# Check the lock info
terraform force-unlock --help

# Force unlock using the Lock ID from the error message
terraform force-unlock LOCK_ID_FROM_ERROR_MESSAGE

# Or check DynamoDB directly for the lock record
aws dynamodb scan --table-name terraform-state-lock

# Delete the lock record manually if needed
aws dynamodb delete-item \
  --table-name terraform-state-lock \
  --key '{"LockID": {"S": "my-bucket/prod/terraform.tfstate"}}'
```

> ⚠️ **Warning:** Only force-unlock if you're 100% sure no other `terraform apply` is actually running. Unlocking during a live apply can corrupt your state file.

After unlocking, run `terraform plan` to see the current state. Use `terraform refresh` to sync state with actual AWS resources.

---

### Q16 — Manage dev, staging, prod with separate state files

> 🎯 **Scenario:** You want to manage dev, staging, and prod environments with the same Terraform code but separate state files.

**Answer:**

**Option 1 — Terraform Workspaces (simple scenarios):**

```bash
terraform workspace new dev
terraform workspace new staging
terraform workspace new prod
terraform workspace select dev
terraform apply
```

```hcl
# Use workspace name in resources
locals {
  instance_type = terraform.workspace == "prod" ? "t3.large" : "t3.micro"
}

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  instance_type = local.instance_type
  tags = { Environment = terraform.workspace }
}
```

**Option 2 — Directory per environment (recommended for production):**

```
infra/
├── modules/
│   ├── vpc/
│   ├── ec2/
│   └── rds/
├── envs/
│   ├── dev/
│   │   ├── main.tf            # calls modules
│   │   ├── terraform.tfvars   # dev-specific values
│   │   └── backend.tf         # dev state: s3/dev/terraform.tfstate
│   ├── staging/
│   └── prod/
```

> ✅ **For production at scale**, use directory-per-environment. It provides complete isolation, different IAM roles per env, and prevents accidentally applying dev config to prod.

---

### Q17 — Share VPC outputs between Terraform configurations

> 🎯 **Scenario:** Your networking team manages the VPC. Your app team manages EC2. How do they share subnet IDs?

**Answer:**

Use **remote state data sources** to read outputs from another Terraform state file:

```hcl
# networking/outputs.tf — networking team exposes these
output "vpc_id"             { value = aws_vpc.main.id }
output "private_subnet_ids" { value = aws_subnet.private[*].id }
output "public_subnet_ids"  { value = aws_subnet.public[*].id }
```

```hcl
# app/main.tf — app team reads networking state
data "terraform_remote_state" "networking" {
  backend = "s3"
  config = {
    bucket = "my-company-terraform-state"
    key    = "prod/networking/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "us-east-1"
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "app" {
  subnet_id              = data.terraform_remote_state.networking.outputs.private_subnet_ids[0]
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.app.id]
}
```

> 💡 **Alternative:** Use AWS SSM Parameter Store or `aws_vpc` data sources with tag filters to reduce tight coupling between state files.

---

### Q18 — Recover from a corrupted or accidentally deleted state file

> 🎯 **Scenario:** Someone accidentally deleted the production state file. How do you recover?

**Answer:**

```bash
# Step 1: Check S3 versioning for previous state versions
aws s3api list-object-versions \
  --bucket my-company-terraform-state \
  --prefix prod/terraform.tfstate

# Step 2: Restore a previous version
aws s3api get-object \
  --bucket my-company-terraform-state \
  --key prod/terraform.tfstate \
  --version-id "VERSION_ID_HERE" \
  terraform.tfstate.backup

# Step 3: Push the restored state back
terraform state push terraform.tfstate.backup

# Step 4: Verify state is healthy
terraform plan  # Should show no unexpected changes
```

> ✅ **This is why S3 versioning is non-negotiable.** Always enable versioning on your state bucket so you can roll back to any previous state version.

## 📦 Modules & Reusability

---

### Q19 — Create a reusable module for 10 microservices

> 🎯 **Scenario:** You have 10 microservices, each needing an ECS service, IAM role, and CloudWatch log group. Copy-pasting Terraform code 10 times is unmanageable.

**Answer:**

Create a **reusable Terraform module:**

```
modules/
└── ecs-service/
    ├── main.tf         # Resources
    ├── variables.tf    # Input variables
    ├── outputs.tf      # Output values
    └── README.md
```

```hcl
# modules/ecs-service/variables.tf
variable "service_name"       { type = string }
variable "cluster_id"         { type = string }
variable "desired_count"      { type = number; default = 2 }
variable "log_retention_days" { type = number; default = 30 }
```

```hcl
# modules/ecs-service/main.tf
resource "aws_ecs_service" "this" {
  name            = var.service_name
  cluster         = var.cluster_id
  task_definition = aws_ecs_task_definition.this.arn
  desired_count   = var.desired_count
}

resource "aws_cloudwatch_log_group" "this" {
  name              = "/ecs/${var.service_name}"
  retention_in_days = var.log_retention_days
}

resource "aws_iam_role" "task_execution" {
  name               = "${var.service_name}-execution-role"
  assume_role_policy = data.aws_iam_policy_document.ecs_assume.json
}
```

```hcl
# Call the module for each service — using for_each
variable "services" {
  type = map(object({ count = number }))
  default = {
    user-service    = { count = 2 }
    payment-service = { count = 3 }
    order-service   = { count = 2 }
  }
}

module "services" {
  for_each      = var.services
  source        = "./modules/ecs-service"
  service_name  = each.key
  desired_count = each.value.count
  cluster_id    = aws_ecs_cluster.main.id
}
```

---

### Q20 — Use a community VPC module from Terraform Registry

> 🎯 **Scenario:** You want to use a community VPC module instead of writing one from scratch.

**Answer:**

```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
  version = "~> 5.1"   # Pin to minor version (allows patches)

  name = "production-vpc"
  cidr = "10.0.0.0/16"

  azs             = ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b", "us-east-1c"]
  private_subnets = ["10.0.1.0/24", "10.0.2.0/24", "10.0.3.0/24"]
  public_subnets  = ["10.0.101.0/24", "10.0.102.0/24", "10.0.103.0/24"]

  enable_nat_gateway   = true
  single_nat_gateway   = false   # One per AZ for HA
  enable_dns_hostnames = true
  enable_dns_support   = true

  tags = { Environment = "prod" }
}

# Use module outputs in other resources
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  subnet_id              = module.vpc.private_subnets[0]
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.web.id]
}
```

> ⚠️ **Always pin module versions** with `version = "~> 5.1"`. Without a pin, `terraform init -upgrade` might pull a breaking major version change.

---

### Q21 — Pass providers into modules for multi-region deployments

> 🎯 **Scenario:** Your module needs to deploy resources in a specific AWS region passed by the caller.

**Answer:**

```hcl
# modules/app/main.tf
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = { source = "hashicorp/aws" }
  }
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "this" {
  bucket = var.bucket_name
}
```

```hcl
# root/main.tf
provider "aws" {
  alias  = "us"
  region = "us-east-1"
}

provider "aws" {
  alias  = "eu"
  region = "eu-west-1"
}

module "app_us" {
  source      = "./modules/app"
  providers   = { aws = aws.us }
  bucket_name = "my-app-us"
}

module "app_eu" {
  source      = "./modules/app"
  providers   = { aws = aws.eu }
  bucket_name = "my-app-eu"
}
```

---

### Q22 — Publish and version a private Terraform module

> 🎯 **Scenario:** Your platform team wants to publish an internal Terraform module that all app teams can use with versioning.

**Answer:**

Use a **Git tag-based versioning** pattern with a private Git registry:

```bash
# Tag your module for versioning
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0

git tag v1.1.0   # Minor feature
git tag v2.0.0   # Breaking change
```

```hcl
# App teams consume from Git with version pinning
module "rds" {
  # GitHub source with specific tag
  source = "git::https://github.com/my-org/terraform-modules.git//rds?ref=v1.1.0"

  db_name        = "myapp"
  instance_class = "db.t3.medium"
}
```

```hcl
# Or use Terraform Cloud/Enterprise private registry
module "rds" {
  source  = "app.terraform.io/my-org/rds/aws"
  version = "~> 1.1"
}
```

## 🔒 Security & IAM

---

### Q23 — Handle hardcoded AWS keys pushed to GitHub

> 🎯 **Scenario:** A developer hardcoded AWS access keys in a Terraform file and pushed to GitHub.

**Answer:**

**Immediate response:**

1. **Revoke the exposed AWS access keys immediately** via IAM console
2. **Check AWS CloudTrail logs** for any unauthorized usage since the commit
3. **Remove keys from git history:** `git filter-branch` or BFG Repo Cleaner
4. **Force-push to GitHub** and notify all team members to re-clone
5. **Audit all other files** for hardcoded secrets using `trufflehog` or `gitleaks`

**Prevention — use IAM roles instead of access keys:**

```hcl
# provider.tf — NO hardcoded keys!
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
  # On EC2/ECS/Lambda: credentials come from instance profile automatically
  # In CI/CD: use OIDC (see Q33)
}
```

```bash
# Scan for secrets in your repo
trufflehog git https://github.com/my-org/my-repo
gitleaks detect --source .
```

> 🚨 **The AWS provider should NEVER have `access_key` or `secret_key` hardcoded.** Add `*.tfvars` and `.env` to `.gitignore`. Use environment variables, AWS profiles, or IAM roles.

---

### Q24 — Create least-privilege IAM role for EC2 → S3 read access

> 🎯 **Scenario:** Security team requires least-privilege IAM policies. EC2 instance should only read from a specific S3 bucket.

**Answer:**

```hcl
# IAM Role
resource "aws_iam_role" "ec2_s3_reader" {
  name = "ec2-s3-reader"
  assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
    Version   = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [{
      Effect    = "Allow"
      Principal = { Service = "ec2.amazonaws.com" }
      Action    = "sts:AssumeRole"
    }]
  })
}

# Least-privilege policy — read from ONE specific bucket only
resource "aws_iam_role_policy" "s3_read" {
  name = "s3-read-specific-bucket"
  role = aws_iam_role.ec2_s3_reader.id

  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Effect   = "Allow"
        Action   = ["s3:GetObject", "s3:ListBucket"]
        Resource = [
          aws_s3_bucket.app.arn,
          "${aws_s3_bucket.app.arn}/*"
        ]
      },
      {
        Effect   = "Deny"    # Explicit deny — belt AND suspenders
        Action   = ["s3:DeleteObject", "s3:PutObject"]
        Resource = "*"
      }
    ]
  })
}

# Instance Profile (attaches role to EC2)
resource "aws_iam_instance_profile" "ec2_profile" {
  name = "ec2-s3-reader-profile"
  role = aws_iam_role.ec2_s3_reader.name
}

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  iam_instance_profile = aws_iam_instance_profile.ec2_profile.name
  # ... other config
}
```

---

### Q25 — Prevent accidental destruction of production RDS

> 🎯 **Scenario:** You need to prevent a critical production RDS instance from being accidentally destroyed via `terraform destroy`.

**Answer:**

```hcl
resource "aws_db_instance" "production" {
  identifier          = "prod-postgres"
  deletion_protection = true      # AWS-level protection

  lifecycle {
    prevent_destroy = true        # Terraform-level protection
    ignore_changes  = [engine_version, password]
  }
}

# Also protect critical S3 buckets
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "critical_data" {
  bucket = "company-critical-data"

  lifecycle {
    prevent_destroy = true
  }
}

# create_before_destroy: for zero-downtime replacement
resource "aws_security_group" "web" {
  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}
```

| Lifecycle Argument | Use Case |
|-------------------|----------|
| `prevent_destroy` | Block any destroy of critical resources |
| `create_before_destroy` | Zero-downtime replacement (new before delete) |
| `ignore_changes` | Ignore drift in specified attributes |
| `replace_triggered_by` | Force replacement when another resource changes |

### Q26 — Manage secrets securely in Terraform

> 🎯 **Scenario:** Your app needs multiple secrets (DB password, API keys, JWT secret). How do you manage them without hardcoding?

**Answer:**

```hcl
# Approach 1: AWS Secrets Manager
data "aws_secretsmanager_secret_version" "app_secrets" {
  secret_id = "prod/myapp/secrets"
}

locals {
  secrets = jsondecode(data.aws_secretsmanager_secret_version.app_secrets.secret_string)
}

resource "aws_ecs_task_definition" "app" {
  container_definitions = jsonencode([{
    name = "app"
    environment = [
      { name = "DB_PASSWORD", value = local.secrets["db_password"] },
      { name = "API_KEY",     value = local.secrets["api_key"]     }
    ]
  }])
}
```

```hcl
# Approach 2: SSM Parameter Store
data "aws_ssm_parameter" "db_password" {
  name            = "/prod/myapp/db-password"
  with_decryption = true
}

resource "aws_instance" "app" {
  user_data = <<-EOF
    export DB_PASSWORD=${data.aws_ssm_parameter.db_password.value}
  EOF
}
```

### Q29 — Create security groups with layered access (ALB → App → DB)

> 🎯 **Scenario:** ALB accepts internet traffic. App server only accepts from ALB. DB only accepts from App server.

**Answer:**

```hcl
# ALB Security Group — accepts internet
resource "aws_security_group" "alb" {
  name   = "alb-sg"
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id

  ingress {
    from_port   = 443
    to_port     = 443
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
  egress { from_port = 0; to_port = 0; protocol = "-1"; cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"] }
}

# App Server SG — only from ALB
resource "aws_security_group" "app" {
  name   = "app-sg"
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id

  ingress {
    from_port       = 8080
    to_port         = 8080
    protocol        = "tcp"
    security_groups = [aws_security_group.alb.id]   # Source = ALB only
  }
  egress { from_port = 0; to_port = 0; protocol = "-1"; cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"] }
}

# Database SG — only from App Server
resource "aws_security_group" "db" {
  name   = "db-sg"
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id

  ingress {
    from_port       = 5432
    to_port         = 5432
    protocol        = "tcp"
    security_groups = [aws_security_group.app.id]   # Source = App only
  }
}
```

### Q30 — Set up VPC Peering between two VPCs

> 🎯 **Scenario:** Your app VPC needs to connect to a shared-services VPC that hosts internal tools.

**Answer:**

```hcl
# VPC Peering Connection
resource "aws_vpc_peering_connection" "app_to_shared" {
  vpc_id      = aws_vpc.app.id
  peer_vpc_id = aws_vpc.shared_services.id
  auto_accept = true    # Works for same-account peering

  tags = { Name = "app-to-shared-services" }
}

# Add routes on BOTH sides
resource "aws_route" "app_to_shared" {
  route_table_id            = aws_route_table.private.id
  destination_cidr_block    = "10.1.0.0/16"  # shared-services CIDR
  vpc_peering_connection_id = aws_vpc_peering_connection.app_to_shared.id
}

resource "aws_route" "shared_to_app" {
  route_table_id            = aws_route_table.shared_private.id
  destination_cidr_block    = "10.0.0.0/16"  # app VPC CIDR
  vpc_peering_connection_id = aws_vpc_peering_connection.app_to_shared.id
}
```

### Q31 — Set up AWS Transit Gateway for hub-and-spoke networking

> 🎯 **Scenario:** You have 10 VPCs that all need to talk to each other. VPC peering becomes unmanageable (n*(n-1)/2 connections).

**Answer:**

```hcl
# Transit Gateway — central hub
resource "aws_ec2_transit_gateway" "main" {
  description                     = "Central TGW"
  default_route_table_association = "enable"
  default_route_table_propagation = "enable"
  auto_accept_shared_attachments  = "enable"

  tags = { Name = "central-tgw" }
}

# Attach each VPC to the TGW
resource "aws_ec2_transit_gateway_vpc_attachment" "app" {
  transit_gateway_id = aws_ec2_transit_gateway.main.id
  vpc_id             = aws_vpc.app.id
  subnet_ids         = aws_subnet.private[*].id
}

resource "aws_ec2_transit_gateway_vpc_attachment" "shared" {
  transit_gateway_id = aws_ec2_transit_gateway.main.id
  vpc_id             = aws_vpc.shared_services.id
  subnet_ids         = aws_subnet.shared_private[*].id
}

# Route traffic to TGW from each VPC
resource "aws_route" "app_to_tgw" {
  route_table_id         = aws_route_table.private.id
  destination_cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/8"  # All internal networks
  transit_gateway_id     = aws_ec2_transit_gateway.main.id
}
```

```

> ✅ Use **OIDC authentication** instead of storing AWS access keys as GitHub secrets. The IAM role trusts GitHub's identity token, making key rotation unnecessary.

---

### Q33 — Set up OIDC so GitHub Actions can assume an AWS IAM role

> 🎯 **Scenario:** Configure the AWS IAM role that GitHub Actions can assume via OIDC without static access keys.

**Answer:**

```hcl
# GitHub OIDC Provider in AWS
resource "aws_iam_openid_connect_provider" "github" {
  url             = "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com"
  client_id_list  = ["sts.amazonaws.com"]
  thumbprint_list = ["6938fd4d98bab03faadb97b34396831e3780aea1"]
}

# IAM Role for GitHub Actions
resource "aws_iam_role" "github_actions_terraform" {
  name = "github-actions-terraform"

  assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [{
      Effect    = "Allow"
      Principal = {
        Federated = aws_iam_openid_connect_provider.github.arn
      }
      Action = "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity"
      Condition = {
        StringEquals = {
          "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:aud" = "sts.amazonaws.com"
        }
        StringLike = {
          # Only allow from specific repo and branch
          "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub" = "repo:my-org/my-repo:ref:refs/heads/main"
        }
      }
    }]
  })
}

resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "terraform_permissions" {
  role       = aws_iam_role.github_actions_terraform.name
  policy_arn = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/PowerUserAccess"
  # Use a custom least-privilege policy in real scenarios
}
```

---

### Q34 — Use Terraform with multiple AWS accounts (dev/prod separation)

> 🎯 **Scenario:** Your organization has separate AWS accounts for dev and prod. How do you manage both from one Terraform pipeline?

**Answer:**

```hcl
# Use assume_role to deploy into target accounts
provider "aws" {
  alias  = "dev"
  region = "us-east-1"
  assume_role {
    role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/TerraformRole"
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  alias  = "prod"
  region = "us-east-1"
  assume_role {
    role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::222222222222:role/TerraformRole"
  }
}

# Deploy to dev account
module "app_dev" {
  source    = "./modules/app"
  providers = { aws = aws.dev }
  env       = "dev"
}

# Deploy to prod account
module "app_prod" {
  source    = "./modules/app"
  providers = { aws = aws.prod }
  env       = "prod"
}
```

### Q36 — Implement drift detection in production

> 🎯 **Scenario:** Your manager wants to be alerted when someone manually changes AWS resources outside of Terraform.

**Answer:**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/drift-detection.yml
name: Terraform Drift Detection

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 8 * * *'   # Run daily at 8 AM UTC

jobs:

          aws-region: us-east-1

      - uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v3

      - name: Check for drift
        id: plan
        run: |
          terraform init
          terraform plan -detailed-exitcode -out=drift.tfplan
        continue-on-error: true

      - name: Alert on drift
        if: steps.plan.outputs.exitcode == '2'   # 2 = changes detected
        uses: actions/github-script@v7
        with:
          script: |
            github.rest.issues.create({
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              title: '⚠️ Terraform Drift Detected!',
              body: 'Terraform plan detected infrastructure drift. Check the workflow run for details.',
              labels: ['infrastructure', 'drift']
            })
```

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

---

### Q37 — Handle infrastructure drift (manual changes in AWS console)

> 🎯 **Scenario:** Terraform plan shows it wants to delete and recreate a production EC2 because someone manually changed its instance type in the console.

**Answer:**

You have three options depending on what should be the source of truth:

**Option A — Accept the manual change (update config to match AWS):**
```bash
# Refresh state to see what AWS actually has
terraform refresh

# Update your .tf file instance_type to match live value
# Then verify plan shows no changes
terraform plan
```

**Option B — Revert to Terraform's desired state:**
```bash
# Apply will change instance type back
terraform apply -target=aws_instance.web
```

**Option C — Ignore that attribute going forward:**
```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [instance_type]  # Ops team manages sizing manually
  }
}
```

---

### Q38 — Fix Terraform cycle errors

> 🎯 **Scenario:** You get `Error: Cycle: aws_security_group.app, aws_security_group.db`. What does this mean and how do you fix it?

**Answer:**

A **cycle error** means two resources depend on each other circularly. Fix by using separate `aws_security_group_rule` resources:

```hcl
# Create SGs WITHOUT inline rules (no circular dependency)
resource "aws_security_group" "app" {
  name   = "app-sg"
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id
}

resource "aws_security_group" "db" {
  name   = "db-sg"
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id
}

# Add rules AFTER both SGs exist — breaks the cycle
resource "aws_security_group_rule" "app_to_db" {
  type                     = "egress"
  from_port                = 5432
  to_port                  = 5432
  protocol                 = "tcp"
  security_group_id        = aws_security_group.app.id
  source_security_group_id = aws_security_group.db.id
}

resource "aws_security_group_rule" "db_from_app" {
  type                     = "ingress"
  from_port                = 5432
  to_port                  = 5432
  protocol                 = "tcp"
  security_group_id        = aws_security_group.db.id
  source_security_group_id = aws_security_group.app.id
}
```

---

### Q39 — Clean up orphaned resources from state

> 🎯 **Scenario:** Terraform plan says it will "destroy" a resource that was already manually deleted from AWS.

**Answer:**

```bash
# List all resources tracked in state
terraform state list

# Remove the orphaned resource from state
# (does NOT touch AWS — only removes from .tfstate)
terraform state rm aws_instance.old_server

# Verify it's gone
terraform state list | grep old_server

# Plan should now show no reference to deleted resource
terraform plan
```

| Command | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| `terraform state rm` | Remove manually deleted resource from state |
| `terraform state mv` | Rename a resource or move it into a module |
| `terraform state show` | View all attributes of a tracked resource |
| `terraform state pull` | Download remote state to local for inspection |
| `terraform state push` | Upload modified state back to remote |

---

### Q40 — Apply changes to specific resources only (targeted apply)

> 🎯 **Scenario:** You want to apply changes only to a specific resource without touching the rest of your infrastructure.

**Answer:**

```bash
# Plan only a specific resource
terraform plan -target=aws_instance.web

# Apply only a specific resource
terraform apply -target=aws_instance.web

# Target multiple resources
terraform apply \
  -target=aws_instance.web \
  -target=aws_security_group.web

# Target a whole module
terraform apply -target=module.vpc

# Destroy only a specific resource
terraform destroy -target=aws_instance.old_server
```

> ⚠️ Use `-target` sparingly — it can leave your state out of sync. Always run a full `terraform plan` after targeted operations.

---

### Q41 — Debug Terraform errors with verbose logging

> 🎯 **Scenario:** Terraform apply is failing with a cryptic error. How do you get more detail?

**Answer:**

```bash
# Enable debug logging
export TF_LOG=DEBUG
terraform apply

# Log levels: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR
export TF_LOG=TRACE
terraform plan 2> terraform-debug.log

# Log to a file
export TF_LOG_PATH=./terraform.log
export TF_LOG=DEBUG
terraform apply

# Useful debug commands
terraform console                          # Interactive expression evaluation
terraform show                             # Show current state
terraform graph | dot -Tsvg > graph.svg    # Visualize dependency graph
```

```hcl
# Test expressions in terraform console
> aws_instance.web.public_ip
"54.12.34.56"

> [for s in aws_subnet.private : s.id]
["subnet-abc", "subnet-def", "subnet-ghi"]
```

## ⚡ Advanced Patterns

---

### Q42 — Use dynamic blocks for variable security group rules

> 🎯 **Scenario:** You need a security group with a variable number of ingress rules per environment. Dev needs 3, prod needs 7.

**Answer:**

```hcl
variable "ingress_rules" {
  type = list(object({
    port        = number
    cidr_blocks = list(string)
    description = string
  }))
  default = [
    { port = 80,  cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"],   description = "HTTP"          },
    { port = 443, cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"],   description = "HTTPS"         },
    { port = 22,  cidr_blocks = ["10.0.0.0/8"], description = "SSH internal"  },
  ]
}

resource "aws_security_group" "web" {
  name   = "web-sg"
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id

  # Dynamic block generates one ingress block per rule in the list
  dynamic "ingress" {
    for_each = var.ingress_rules
    content {
      from_port   = ingress.value.port
      to_port     = ingress.value.port
      protocol    = "tcp"
      cidr_blocks = ingress.value.cidr_blocks
      description = ingress.value.description
    }
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}
```

### Q43 — Manage 15 AWS accounts with Terragrunt

> 🎯 **Scenario:** Your organization has 15 AWS accounts. Managing backends and provider configs is getting unmanageable.

**Answer:**

**Terragrunt** — a thin wrapper that DRYs up repetitive Terraform configuration:

```
infra/
├── terragrunt.hcl             # Root config — auto backend, provider
├── dev/
│   ├── terragrunt.hcl         # Dev account settings
│   ├── vpc/
│   │   └── terragrunt.hcl     # Inherits root + dev config
│   └── eks/
│       └── terragrunt.hcl
├── staging/
└── prod/
    ├── terragrunt.hcl
    └── vpc/
        └── terragrunt.hcl
```

```hcl
# Root terragrunt.hcl — auto-generates backend config per module
remote_state {
  backend = "s3"
  config = {
    bucket         = "tf-state-${local.account_id}"
    key            = "${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-lock"
    encrypt        = true
  }
  generate = {
    path      = "backend.tf"
    if_exists = "overwrite"
  }
}

# Generate provider configuration
generate "provider" {
  path      = "provider.tf"
  if_exists = "overwrite"
  contents = <<EOF
provider "aws" {
  region = "${local.aws_region}"
  assume_role {
    role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::${local.account_id}:role/TerraformRole"
  }
}
EOF
}
```

```bash
# Run across all environments at once
terragrunt run-all plan    # Plans all modules
terragrunt run-all apply   # Applies all in dependency order
```

### Q44 — Deploy to multiple AWS regions with provider aliases

> 🎯 **Scenario:** Deploy the same infrastructure to us-east-1 and eu-west-1 using the same code.

**Answer:**

```hcl
# Primary region
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

# Secondary region — aliased
provider "aws" {
  alias  = "eu"
  region = "eu-west-1"
}

# Deploy in primary (uses default provider)
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "primary" {
  bucket = "my-app-us-east-1"
}

# Deploy in EU — note provider = aws.eu
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "replica" {
  provider = aws.eu
  bucket   = "my-app-eu-west-1"
}

# S3 cross-region replication
resource "aws_s3_bucket_replication_configuration" "replica" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.primary.id
  role   = aws_iam_role.replication.arn

  rule {
    id     = "replicate-all"
    status = "Enabled"
    destination {
      bucket        = aws_s3_bucket.replica.arn
      storage_class = "STANDARD_IA"
    }
  }
}

# Pass aliased provider into a module
module "app_eu" {
  source    = "./modules/app"
  providers = { aws = aws.eu }
  region    = "eu-west-1"
}
```

### Q45 — Taint vs Replace — what's the difference?

> 🎯 **Scenario:** "What is the difference between `terraform taint` and `terraform apply -replace`?"

**Answer:**

| Command | Terraform Version | What it does |
|---------|-------------------|--------------|
| `terraform taint` | Deprecated in 0.15.2 | Marks resource as "tainted" in state — forces destroy+recreate on next apply |
| `terraform apply -replace` | 0.15.2+ (replacement) | Forces destroy+recreate in a single operation |

```bash
# OLD way (deprecated)
terraform taint aws_instance.web
terraform apply

# NEW way — Terraform 0.15.2+
terraform apply -replace=aws_instance.web

# Replace multiple resources
terraform apply \
  -replace=aws_instance.web \
  -replace=aws_launch_template.web
```

**When to use `-replace`:**
1. EC2 instance is in a bad state and needs a fresh start
2. SSL certificate needs to be rotated (force new cert resource)
3. Instance has configuration drift that can't be fixed in-place
4. Testing replacement behavior for a resource type

terraform state list                    # List all tracked resources
terraform state show aws_instance.web   # Inspect a resource in state
terraform state rm aws_instance.old     # Remove from state (not AWS)
terraform state mv old_name new_name    # Rename resource in state
terraform state pull                    # Download remote state
terraform state push                    # Upload state to remote
terraform refresh                       # Sync state with AWS
```

### Import & Replace

```bash
terraform import aws_s3_bucket.b name   # Import existing resource
terraform apply -replace=aws_instance.x # Force recreate a resource
terraform apply -target=module.vpc      # Apply only specific resource
terraform force-unlock LOCK_ID          # Remove stuck state lock
```

### Workspaces

```bash
terraform workspace list                # List all workspaces
terraform workspace new dev             # Create workspace
terraform workspace select prod         # Switch workspace
terraform workspace show                # Show current workspace
terraform workspace delete dev          # Delete workspace
```

### Debug & Inspect

```bash
terraform console                       # Interactive HCL console
terraform show                          # Show current state
terraform output -json                  # Get outputs as JSON
terraform graph | dot -Tsvg > g.svg     # Dependency graph
TF_LOG=DEBUG terraform plan             # Verbose debug logging
```

### Providers & Versions

```bash
terraform providers                     # List providers in use
terraform providers lock                # Lock provider versions
terraform init -upgrade                 # Upgrade provider versions
terraform version                       # Show Terraform version
```

### Useful Variable Patterns

```hcl
# Default with validation
variable "environment" {
  type    = string
  default = "dev"
  validation {
    condition     = contains(["dev", "staging", "prod"], var.environment)
    error_message = "Must be dev, staging, or prod."
  }
}

# Complex object variable
variable "instances" {
  type = map(object({
    instance_type = string
    count         = number
  }))
}

# Sensitive variable (hidden from logs)
variable "db_password" {
  type      = string
  sensitive = true
}
```

### Common HCL Functions

```hcl
length(list)                 # Count items
contains(list, value)        # Check if value in list
lookup(map, key, default)    # Map lookup with default
merge(map1, map2)            # Merge maps
flatten(list_of_lists)       # Flatten nested lists
toset(list)                  # Convert list to set (dedup)
jsonencode(object)           # Encode to JSON string
jsondecode(string)           # Decode JSON string
base64encode(string)         # Base64 encode
filebase64sha256("file.zip") # SHA256 hash of file
format("%-10s %s", a, b)     # String formatting
```

## 🎯 Interview Tips

| Topic | What Interviewers Want to Hear |
|-------|-------------------------------|
| **State** | Remote backend (S3+DynamoDB), locking, encryption, versioning |
| **Secrets** | Never hardcode. Use Secrets Manager, SSM, or OIDC |
| **Modules** | DRY code, versioned, well-documented, for_each usage |
| **CI/CD** | OIDC auth, plan on PR, apply on merge, checkov/tflint gates |
| **Environments** | Directory-per-env or workspaces, separate state files |
| **Safety** | `prevent_destroy`, `create_before_destroy`, `plan -out` |
| **Debugging** | `TF_LOG=DEBUG`, `terraform console`, `state commands` |
| **Drift** | Daily plan schedules, `ignore_changes`, `terraform refresh` |
