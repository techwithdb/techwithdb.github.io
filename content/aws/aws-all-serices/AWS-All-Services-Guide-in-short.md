## Amazon EC2

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Category** | Compute |
| **Full Name** | Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud |

### 🔍 Why It Is Used
Amazon EC2 provides resizable virtual servers in the cloud, eliminating the need to invest in physical hardware upfront. It allows you to scale up or down within minutes, paying only for what you use. EC2 is the backbone of most cloud architectures when persistent, configurable virtual machines are needed.

### ⚙️ Functionality
- Launch virtual machines (instances) with hundreds of configurations (CPU, RAM, GPU, storage).
- Choose from various instance families: General Purpose (t3, m6i), Compute Optimized (c6i), Memory Optimized (r6i), GPU (p4), Storage Optimized (i3).
- Attach Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes as persistent disk storage.
- Use Auto Scaling Groups to automatically adjust capacity.
- Configure Security Groups as virtual firewalls.
- Support for On-Demand, Reserved, Spot, and Dedicated Host pricing models.
- Placement Groups for high-performance computing clusters.
- Elastic IPs for static public addresses.
